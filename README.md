## NumPy Scientific Calculator

This is a Python-based scientific calculator that leverages the power of NumPy and SciPy for advanced mathematical operations. The calculator allows users to perform a variety of mathematical tasks, ranging from basic arithmetic and trigonometric calculations to more complex set theory, statistics, and matrix operations.

### Features
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, roots, and absolute values.
- **Trigonometry**: Compute sin, cos, tan, cosecant, secant, cotangent, and logarithmic functions.
- **Set Theory**: Operations like union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, and finding unique values.
- **Statistics**: Calculate median, mean, mode, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles.
- **Matrices**: Matrix operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and determinant calculation.
  
### Error Handling
This calculator includes robust error handling, ensuring that incorrect inputs (such as invalid numbers, matrix dimension mismatches, or division by zero) are caught and handled gracefully.

### Technologies Used
- **NumPy**: Used for matrix operations, trigonometry, and other mathematical calculations.
- **SciPy**: Used for statistical functions, such as mode calculation.
